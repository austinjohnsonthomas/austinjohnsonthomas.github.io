									<h1>IKIGAI Page</h1>
									<p><b>The 10 Rules of IKIGAI: </b>The Japanese Secrets To a Long and Happy Life</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ikigai.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The book IKIGAI: The Japanese Secret To a Long and Happy Life by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles, is more of a case study on the lives of the long-living residents from Ogimi, a small village in Okinawa, than an explanation or guide to understanding Ikigai.</p>
								<p>Your lifestyle will be very different to the centenarians of Ogami. You probably work, live in a city, have many responsibilities, financial stress, relationship problems and many things on your mind and so on. It may be hard for you to adopt all 10 rules, but some are very easy to implement.</p>
								<p>Keep in mind these aren't rules that you must follow in order to achieve ikigai, but suggestions or habits you could adopt to improve your health and well being so you can discover and live your ikigai.</p>
								<p>A question you can ask yourself is, "What rules can I easily implement that will help me with my day to day life?"</p>

								<h3>The 10 Rules of Ikigai</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>1. Stay active; don't retire.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That's why it's so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your“official” professional activity has ended.”</p>
										</dd>
										
										<dt>2. Take it slow.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to the quality of life. As the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you'll go far.” When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.”</p>
											<p>If you are in a hurry it incites that you are not in control and under stress. By taking things slow it means you are more mindful of your decisions, in control and more often than not doing the things you want to do.</p>
										</dd>
										
										<dt>3. Don't fill your stomach.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.”</p>
										</dd>
										
										<dt>4. Surround yourself with good friends.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.”</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>5. Get in shape for your next birthday.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn't stagnate. The body you move through in life needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.”</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>6. Smile</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing, it also helps make friends. It's good to recognize the things that aren't so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.”</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>7. Reconnect with nature</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>8. Give thanks</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks, and you'll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.”</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>9. Live in the moment</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.”</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>10. Follow your ikigai</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>“There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don't know what your ikigai is yet, your mission is to discover it.”</p>
										</dd>
